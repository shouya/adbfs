# ADB Filesystem
__NOTICE:__ This project is not complete.

This project was created in order to trying fuse filesystem creation
and a speed-optimized version of existing adbfs project.

This version of program support only real directories and files (no
symbolic links). And will not be further maintained. It's a very
simple program with even simpler logic, you can create one with
yourself in 10 mins, and that would be better than mine.

## Usage
`ruby adbfs.rb <mount point>`


## Copyright
Have you seen someone tagged a copyright mark on an unfinished
project?

No?

That's kidding. Just take it anytime, and do anything if you really
want this junk program.
